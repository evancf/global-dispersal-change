# global-dispersal-change
Modeling change in climate-tracking seed dispersal provided by birds and mammals

Data and code used to reproduce analyses and figures from "The Effects of Defaunation on Plants' Capacity to Track Climate Change". Running the 'analysis.R' script within the analyis folder will load in the data and call on the other scripts within the analysis folder to reproduce analyses and figures. Note that saved versions of boosted regression tree model outputs are loaded for the 'analysis.R' script to avoid refitting the long-running models.
